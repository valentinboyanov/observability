# Overview

This repository documents my exploration of [infrastructure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IT_infrastructure) in software development.

The main goal is to better understand my current level, identify knowledge gaps, and become more familiar with both conceptual and implementation tools that represent the state of the art in this field.

I've asked my friend [@igarridot](https://github.com/igarridot) for guidance, and he kindly recommended the following:
- Use the "knowledge ladder" framework to assess my current position in infrastructure and backend development.
- Build a solution that enables a small product team to implement [observability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observability_(software)) for their product.
